    "authorName": "Nur Hidayati",
    "country": "Indonesia",
    "abstract": "AI tools have become widely used in the educational field, providing students with innovative approaches to improve their academic performance. This study examined the perceptions of post-graduate students majoring in English Education regarding the use of Quillbot in academic writing. The study employed a qualitative methodology within an interpretive paradigm. A total of 14 students participated in semi-structured interviews to gather in-depth insights into their experiences. The results showed that students frequently used Quillbot due to its efficiency and ability to paraphrase texts effectively. However, some students expressed concerns regarding the accuracy of Quillbot in preserving the original meaning and noting that some of the insights generated were not entirely suitable for academic writing. Furthermore, while some students believed that Quillbot contributed positively to their vocabulary mastery and comprehension of the material, others considered that using Quillbot reduced their active engagement and comprehensive understanding of the content. This duality of perception highlights the need for critical evaluation of AI tools in academic writing context. Ultimately, this research provides important insights into the role of AI tools, such as Quillbot, in academic writing practices, suggesting while it offers significant benefits, it also presents challenges that must be addressed to enhance writing outcomes effectively.",

    "country": "Philippines",
    "abstract": "The heart of curriculum design is to give opportunities and provide support to students so they can achieve understanding and transfer of learning. This is made possible when teachers produce well-written learning modules. Back in 2015, an initial evaluation of the Understanding by Design (UbD) framework in writing learning modules was conducted. Results show that high school teachers of De La Salle Santiago Zobel (DLSZ) appreciate the concise and practical guidance of backward design in curriculum planning. In this reevaluation study, the question I desire to find answers to is: How is the UbD framework extensively used by Junior High School (JHS) teachers in writing learning modules? Primary research data were obtained by conducting an online survey using Google Forms among all JHS teachers and administrators (N=92) across 12 subject areas. There were 12 items in the survey questionnaire. Eleven (11) items pertained to the three (3) stages of the UbD framework, while one (1) item was concerned with how helpful the design framework is in systematically preparing the learning modules. Furthermore, an open-ended question was asked on the suggestions of teachers in making the learning modules more relevant and useful to them as users, and more effective in obtaining our instructional goals. Three (3) focus group discussions using Google Jamboard were held with nine (9) JHS educators to validate their perceptions in the use of the said framework. In addition, document analysis of 12 learning modules (6 core learning areas and 6 special subjects) was conducted to determine how evident the UbD framework is used by teachers based on its three (3) stages. This study employed a mixed-method approach where quantitative data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, while descriptive data were analyzed using thematic analysis.",

    "abstract": "The inclusion of persons with disabilities (PWDs), particularly Physically Challenged Persons, in the local governance structures of Bangladesh remains a significant challenge despite national and international commitments toward inclusivity. This exclusion is largely due to socio-cultural stigmas, insufficient legal frameworks, and the lack of awareness about disability rights among local authorities. In this backdrop, this study attempts to see how far the inclusion of Physically Challenged Persons is being implemented in the domain of local government. Accordingly, the prime objective has been set to assess the present scenario of Physically Challenged Persons’ inclusion in local government and to unveil the problems they encounter and the prospects therein for effective inclusion of PWDs. A mixed-method approach was applied, combining both qualitative and quantitative methods, consisting of a sample survey among 100 Physically Challenged Persons, 50 KIIs, and 1 FGD. The study brings to the surface that hardly PWDs have any space or opportunity for their inclusion or participation in any form in the affairs of local government. Their voices are never heard; therefore, government intervention in the form of policies, plans, projects, and programs is being called for full inclusion of PWDs in the local government.",

    "country": "India",
    "abstract": "Emotion recognition through physiological signals has received significant attention in domains such as mental health, education, and human-computer interaction. Electrodermal activity (EDA), identified as a sensitive index of the sympathetic nervous system, is a widely preferred technique in analyzing emotional states. This paper presents an exploratory analysis of minimally preprocessed and non-decomposed electrodermal activity signal amplitudes. It examines the potential of exploring raw time series data from EDA for emotion classification with reduced computational effort. Analysis of electrodermal activity (EDA) data from the DEAP dataset, without prior signal decomposition, revealed that the average time series amplitude per emotion class exhibits characteristic trends and patterns. Results show that amplitude values within specific time ranges can enhance feature sets to identify and classify emotion according to the 2D valence-arousal space. The proposed method is advantageous for lightweight emotion classification models where real-time monitoring and biofeedback are critical. This work provides valuable insights into advanced emotion recognition, paving the way for innovative applications within affective computing and related fields.",

This study explored the properties of sweet potato bioplastic samples to address plastic waste, focusing on tensile strength. The researchers created bioplastic samples using a mixture of sweet potato starch, vinegar, glycerin, and water. Tensile testing of 24 sweet potato bioplastics revealed that samples containing 7 mL of glycerin consistently exhibited greater ultimate strengths compared to those with 11 mL of glycerin. Specifically, samples containing activated carbon and 7 mL of glycerin had the highest mean ultimate strength (0.567 MPa), whereas those with no activated carbon but 11 mL of glycerin had the lowest (0.1483 MPa). Additionally, the samples with activated carbon and 7 mL of glycerin demonstrated the highest modulus of elasticity (1.3332 MPa) and yield strength (0.3311 MPa). These findings suggest that sweet potato bioplastics, particularly those with activated carbon and 7 mL of glycerin, have the potential to be a strong and sustainable alternative to conventional plastics.

    "abstract": "In Peru, Spanish is spoken alongside 48 native languages, and many speakers of these languages currently attend universities. Additionally, increased access to mobile phones and laptops has fostered the habit of studying while listening to music among students. In this context, this study was conducted to determine whether bilingual students experience more or fewer attention fluctuations than their monolingual counterparts and whether studying while listening to music affects them. This research employs a quantitative approach, utilizing an experimental laboratory method. The study involved two groups of university students—one bilingual and the other monolingual—from five universities in the departments of Junín and Huancavelica, who voluntarily participated in the experiment. Attention fluctuations were assessed using a digital tachistoscope during a focused attention task. The experiment was conducted under two conditions: with and without auditory stimulation. The results indicated, among other findings, that there are no statistical differences in intragroup comparisons (with and without auditory stimulation). However, differences emerge when comparing bilinguals to monolinguals. In conclusion, studying while listening to music does not affect students' attention, whether bilingual or monolingual. Nonetheless, being bilingual appears to present a disadvantage compared to monolinguals, at least concerning attention fluctuations.",

    "designation": "Indonesia",
    "country": "Indonesia",
    "abstract": "This study examines how Narasi TV and TV One News represented the Emergency Warning movement in Indonesia. It combines Fairclough’s (1995) three-dimensional framework and Van Dijk’s ideological square to compare mass media depictions at the textual and discursive levels. The sample consisted of four articles from Narasi TV and three from TV One News. To analyze the news articles, the researchers applied Van Dijk’s Ideological Square (1998) combined with Fairclough’s Three-Dimensional Model (1989, 1995). The results revealed that both media outlets recognized the Emergency Warning movement as “the ingroup” and the regime’s figures as “the outgroup.” This can be seen in the absence of any negative predications or reported speech that describes the movement as rebels or illegals. However, while Narasi TV delivered the Emergency Warning as a call for public movement and a critical reflection on the state of Indonesian democracy, TV One News adopted a more neutral approach, focusing on the social media virality of the movement and reactions from public figures without explicitly endorsing or opposing it. These contrasts highlight how media can shape public perception and civic engagement. This study contributes to the understanding that mass media has its own ideology in presenting news and how this ideological view can influence readers to act and participate in the movement. The researcher suggests broadening this study by examining diverse media outlets and audience responses to democratic movements, offering insights into the media's role in shaping civic engagement across cultural contexts.",

    "country": " Philippines",
    "abstract": "This study explores how organizational collaborative culture mediates the relationship between leadership qualities and managerial effectiveness in satellite campuses of higher education institutions, addressing the lack of studies combining these variables in the context of academic institutions, particularly in satellite campus settings. Leadership qualities, including conscientiousness, adaptability, integrity, and empathy, were examined for their influence on managerial effectiveness, which includes people management, task management, conflict management, and strategic management. Organizational collaborative culture, characterized by professional collaboration, affiliative collegiality, and self-determination, emerged as a significant mediator in this relationship. Using a descriptive quantitative, causal, and cross-sectional design, data were gathered from full-time teaching and non-teaching personnel across 12 satellite campuses of a state university in the Philippines. The results reveal that organizational culture partially mediates the relationship between leadership qualities and managerial effectiveness. This highlights the critical need for culturally responsive leadership strategies that align with organizational goals and values. These findings provide valuable insights for leadership development and support the proposal of a Managerial Effectiveness Framework tailored for academic institutions. This framework aims to enhance leadership and management practices in decentralized campus settings, ensuring that campus heads and leaders are equipped to foster both effective management and an organizational collaborative culture.",

    "abstract": "Global climate change and environmental degradation highlight the need for the implementation of Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) in schools. Gerakan ESD Indonesia initiated the 40-Day Challenge to build resilient ESD communities among teachers and students through concrete action projects that address the impacts of climate change. The program engages teachers and students in undertaking 40 days projects designed to foster student future-thinking skills and long-term sustainable action, with teachers as the main facilitators. This research aims to evaluate the strengths, weaknesses, challenges, and solutions faced during the implementation of the 40 Days Challenge. The program involved 737 students and 112 teachers from 32 districts across Indonesia, with a focus on creating strong ESD communities. Teachers receive training in future-oriented learning techniques, including forecasting, scenario planning, and backcasting, to equip them to guide students in identifying and planning long-term solutions to sustainability challenges. The research methods used include an in-depth analysis of the programs strengths and weaknesses, identifying obstacles faced, and providing recommendations for further development. The findings show that the 40-Day Challenge effectively fosters sustainable habits in students through practical activities such the use of renewable energy, waste management, tree planting, and other activities in raising awareness of the importance of sustainability. Training for teachers increases their effectiveness as facilitators in guiding ESD projects, strengthening their skills in sustainable education. However, there are challenges, especially in remote schools with limited internet access and other resources, which hinder the delivery of digital- based programs. The duration of 40 days also causes difficulties in maintaining the commitment and consistency of participants. The study recommends follow-up actions, including local stakeholder engagement, infrastructure upgrades and technology support, and digital monitoring systems to streamline program evaluation and continuity. Overall, the 40 Days Challenge has proven to be effective in building strong ESD communities in Indonesian schools, with promising potential as a national model for sustainability education. The program is expected to equip the younger generation with important future-thinking skills and encourage active involvement in environmental sustainability efforts at the school and community levels.",

    "designation": "Indonesia",
    "country": "Indonesia",
    "abstract": "Image transmission technology has made significant contributions to various fields, especially medical imaging, which employs X-ray imaging to detect abnormalities in the human body, such as cracks and fractures. The image segmentation method is a computational method that can divide digital images into several segments with similar visual characteristics. This research proposes a novel image segmentation method for wrist fractures, utilising an adaptive weighted-loss approach. The objective is to enhance the precision of identifying wrist fractures on X-ray images, with the target being an accuracy of 71%, a precision of 78%, a recall of 85%, and an F1-score of 81%. This study addresses a significant gap in the literature by proposing an effective method for identifying wrist fractures, a task for which there has been a dearth of effective methods. The adaptive weighted-loss method with linear weights proposed in this study is expected to overcome the challenges posed by overfitting and correct class imbalance, thereby ensuring that the model is not overly dependent on a single loss function. This approach is anticipated to enhance the model's generalisation capabilities on test data.",

    "abstract": "Research integrating marketing and mental health remains exceedingly scarce. Meanwhile, mental health issues have been emerging globally and taken seriously by the WHO. Indonesia is no exception. These issues happen in every country. In Indonesia itself, there have been many companies that have entered the digital mental health service (DMHS) business, but the adoption rate remains inconsistent and significantly lower than the rising incidence of mental health cases every year. This study aims to discover and analyze what factors can influence an individual's intention to purchase DMHS, which intention to purchase is vital for consumer adoption towards DMHS. This study examined some variables, namely perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, brand competence, perceived privacy protection, attitude, and intention to purchase DMHS. This study used quantitative methods with an online survey to collect the primary data and used five-point Likert-type scales to examine the measurement items for each variable. The back-translation technique was used to make sure the translated measurement items accurately conveyed the same measurement with the modified items from the previous studies. The research respondents were 570 respondents, aged around 18–45 years, who had shopped online in the last 6 months. Anyone who meets these criteria could participate in the study, as our goal is to make this research as accessible as possible to all individuals, as mental health affects everyone. The level of mental health issues being faced by respondents when the data was taken was also measured using 21 self-report items from the DASS instrument. Questions about respondents' consent were asked in the questionnaire. This study used the PLS-SEM analysis technique with smartPLS software. The research findings showed significant results except for brand competence and perceived privacy protection. However, their influence on the consumers’ intention to purchase DMHS was indirect via attitude towards purchasing DMHS. The same thing did not happen with perceived ease of use and attitude. There was no evidence that perceived ease of use has an effect on attitude, and there was no evidence that attitude can mediate the relationship between perceived ease of use and intention to purchase DMHS.",

    "abstract": "This study explores the application of the Flipped Classroom Model in teaching reading to English as a Foreign Language (EFL) students in China. The traditional teacher-centered approach often limits students’ engagement and comprehension, necessitating innovative methods to enhance reading proficiency. The Flipped Classroom Model, by shifting direct instruction outside the classroom and allocating class time for interactive learning, offers a promising alternative. This paper examines the effectiveness of this model in improving reading comprehension and engagement among Chinese EFL learners. A quantitative research design was employed, with data collected through surveys, interviews, and classroom observations. The findings indicate that students in the flipped classroom demonstrated higher levels of reading comprehension, engagement, and motivation compared to those in traditional settings. Key challenges, including access to technology and teacher readiness, were also identified. The study contributes to existing literature by validating the theoretical underpinnings of constructivist learning and self-determination theory in EFL contexts. It also highlights the need for further research on integrating emerging technologies and cultural adaptations in flipped learning environments. The results provide valuable insights for educators, policymakers, and researchers seeking to enhance EFL reading instruction through innovative pedagogical strategies.",

Since the inception of the disruptive innovation theory in 1997 by Clayton Christensen, much academic literature has been engendered to evolve the theory and make it compelling over time. However, hardly any literature has emphasized enough to study companies (established or start-up) functioning in different industries. As a result, the practical implication of disruptive innovation theory is largely unexplored. Hence, there is a gap between theoretical framework and real-life business practices, hatching anomalies and discourse among critics from industry practitioners to academia. Particularly, disruptive innovation practices in the ed-tech, fin-tech, and e-commerce industries, presenting new value propositions in developing economies, are yet to be revealed significantly. The disruptive innovation in the organization often requires visionary leadership, a mindset to challenge the status quo, creative destruction, and dynamic management practices to empower disruptive thoughts to flourish.

    "country": "Bangladesh",
    "abstract": "Teacher stress has been extensively studied historically; however, most existing research emphasizes primary, secondary, and higher education contexts, while kindergarten teachers remain relatively understudied. Given the unique characteristics of early childhood education, kindergarten teachers encounter special psychological and cognitive challenges, which makes it necessary for academic researchers to deeper explore into their stress-related experiences. This study employs bibliometric techniques and analytical tools such as VOSviewer and CiteSpace within Web of Science and Scopus database. Results indicate a growing research interest in cognition-related factors, metacognition and cognitive flexibility, within kindergarten teacher stress research in recent years. Such factors are closely related to the stress coping, emotion regulation and teaching efficacy of kindergarten teachers. Literature cluster analysis further shows that the current research tends to integrate social cognitive theory, resource conservation theory and cognitive load theory, emphasizing the key role of cognitive factors in the formation and alleviation of stress in kindergarten teachers. In addition, the study also clearly pointed out that there is a relative lack of empirical research on cognitive intervention for kindergarten teachers, and more targeted and practical cognitive improvement programs should be explored in the future, including in-depth intervention experimental research, cross-cultural comparative analysis, and longitudinal research on Photograph Organization Logo how cognitive mechanisms affect teacher stress. The research results provide an important theoretical basis and practical guidance for in-depth understanding of the mental health protection mechanism of kindergarten teachers and the improvement of policy and practical intervention strategies in the field of early childhood education.",

    "country": "Malaysia",
    "abstract": "Online food delivery applications (OFD apps) have existed in Malaysia for more than a decade. It has received a wide range of customer acceptance among the young and adults in Malaysia. However, the paradigm of customer satisfaction in the OFD apps has shifted since the COVID-19 pandemic struck the world. There were several recent research conducted to identify the factors that affected Malaysian tertiary students’ satisfaction towards OFD apps. However, past research did not study the aspect of OFD apps’ content and user interface (UI) design from a mobile application’s usability study perspective. Moreover, past research also did not classify or cluster the customers to understand them from a deeper perspective. This research attempted to explore the factors affecting Malaysian tertiary students' satisfaction with OFD apps with two data mining methods multiple regression analysis (MRA) and K-means clustering analysis, by using questionnaire data collected from 156 Malaysia tertiary students. The output of the analysis will help the OFD service providers to understand the student customer group better and be able to plan the right resources to manage the app's quality and services.",

    "designation": "Malaysia",
    "country": "Malaysia",
    "abstract": "E-commerce giants Amazon and Alibaba significantly impact the global economy, but their stock return volatility presents challenges for investors and analysts. Traditional volatility models often fail to capture sudden fluctuations, necessitating systematic monitoring through control charts. This study aims to (1) evaluate the performance of the GARCH model in representing stock returns, (2) detect stock return volatility using residual-based control charts (RBCC), (3) compare stock returns between Alibaba and Amazon, and (4) determine whether fluctuations stem from natural market trends or special factors. Using daily opening prices from August 1, 2023, to July 31, 2024, stock returns are analyzed with a GARCH(1,1) model to estimate volatility. Residuals are then examined with Exponential Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) and Cumulative Sum (CUSUM) control charts to detect anomalies. By linking these anomalies to economic events, key drivers of stock return fluctuations are identified. Findings indicate that residual-based control charts effectively detect unusual stock return behaviors, highlighting their potential in financial market analysis. This study offers investors a systematic approach to monitoring stock volatility and contributes to financial research by demonstrating the effectiveness of RBCC in detecting structural market shifts and inefficiencies.",

    "country": "India",
    "abstract": "The petroleum industry requires stringent quality control procedures for conventional Statistical Process Control (SPC) techniques that tend to be unsatisfactory in dealing with imprecise and uncertain data and thus cannot provide the optimal solution in intricate petroleum processing scenarios. This paper reviews the enhanced fuzzy control charts for enhancing petroleum quality monitoring through effective control of process variation under uncertainty. Optimization methods such as AI-based tuning, adaptive thresholding, and hybrid machine learning that enhance the accuracy and reliability of control charts. In addition, fuzzy logic is integrated with the conventional SPC techniques in the critical performance metrics like detection sensitivity, false alarm rates, and process condition flexibility. The findings demonstrate that fuzzy control charts optimized using fuzzy logic are superior to conventional methods because they are more accurate, variable, and steady in identifying process anomalies. AI-based fuzzy models also enhance performance by reducing false alarms and control limits adjusted adaptively based on real-time variations. The interaction between evolutionary algorithms and deep learning models improves the forecasting ability, and very effective at optimizing operations, fuel blending, and contamination detection. Further involvement of AI, fuzzy logic, and big data analytics will transform to make it efficient and sustainable for petroleum quality prediction.",

Diagnosing the intra party culture, when the whole issue is discussed with the concerned stakeholders in both Brazil and South Asia, it has been identified that democracy with a system’s ability to meet primary socio-economic needs rather than with predominantly procedural features. 2 The present situation of crises which the democratic system is facing is the ability of electoral candidate to govern has become less important than other aspects and somewhere the realities of socio-political system that have not been able to be unearthed. Sometimes it becomes a matter of grave thinking whether we have been moving towards the process of democratization or non-democratizing the institutions and their functioning. Although we find the culture of intra party democracy in the Indian political system in a very less quantum state and the crises during pandemic also exaggerated the situation to become worse and the internal political parties’ structural procedures have not remained untouched with it. The above mentioned facts are the basis behind conducting this experimental study in the times of inner party democratic transitions.",

    "abstract": "Spatial writing has emerged as a significant analytical approach in contemporary literary research. This study examines the spatial writing strategies in Shih Shuching's novels, focusing on the intentionality of daily spaces and the dynamics between public and private spheres. Drawing on spatial theories from Bakhtin, Bachelard, and other critical theorists, the research delves into the nuanced spatial representations in Shih Shuching's literary works. Through a meticulous analysis of spatial narratives, the study reveals how Shih Shuching's intricate spatial writing not only portrays the complex social landscape of the city but also probes deeply into the complicated relationships between individual lived experiences and broader social structures. The research argues that space transcends mere narrative background, functioning instead as a generative field of meaning and a crucial dimension for comprehending literary texts. By interrogating the subtle interplays of space, identity, and social dynamics, this study contributes to a deeper understanding of Shih Shuching's literary aesthetics. It offers insights into the broader mechanisms of spatial representation in contemporary literature.",

    "abstract": "Liquidity risk is a crucial factor that can impact the performance of banks, particularly in the rural banking sector. This article investigates the influence of liquidity risk on the financial performance of 92 Philippine rural banks from 2018 to 2022. The study employed descriptive data and quantitative methods, including financial ratios and Pearson r correlational research design. The data used is secondary data. Liquidity risk is measured using the loan-to- deposit ratio, and financial performance is measured using the return on equity ratio. The study used asset-liability management and liquidity preference theory frameworks, which provide a theoretical lens to understand the dynamics between liquidity risk and a bank&#39;s financial performance. The findings suggest no significant relationship between liquidity risk and bank performance, indicating that liquidity risk may not be a primary driver of financial outcomes for these institutions. The results of this study elucidate the intricate relationship between risk and performance in the rural banking sector, which can inform policy and strategic decisions to enhance the financial stability and viability of these critical community-based financial institutions. Future research should adopt a multi-faceted approach to investigate the determinants of financial performance in Philippine rural banks such as predictive models by simultaneously examining the influence of a comprehensive suite of factors. This may include, a wider array of financial ratios beyond loan-to-deposit and return on equity, encompassing capital adequacy, asset quality, and efficiency metrics.",

    "abstract": "China's inflation rate (IR) has generally remained moderately fluctuating, while the unemployment rate (UR) has shown a phased upward trend under economic transformation. Studying these two fields is conducive to the central bank 39s regulation and control of fiscal and monetary policies. Given China's distinct economic structure and government-controlled labor market, it remains unclear whether the classical Phillips Curve (PC) or the New Keynesian Phillips Curve (NKPC) holds in this context. The research aims to test the theoretical feasibility of applying PC models within China's economy and provide empirical insights into inflation- unemployment dynamics. To capture both short- and long-term dynamics, annual data from 1978 to 2021 was utilized and applied to the linear regression model and autoregressive distributed lag (ADL) model to test the performance of the classical PC and the NKPC in China respectively. The findings of the Johansen cointegration test indicate the independent variables—UR, gross domestic product index (GDPI), exchange rate (ER), and national savings rate (NSR)—demonstrate a long-term influence on the dependent variable IR, which supports the applicability of the PC in this context. From an academic perspective, the study enriches the literature by extending the PC framework to a developing, transitionary economy, offering a methodological reference for future research.",
